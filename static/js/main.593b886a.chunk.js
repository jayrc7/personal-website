That\u2019s it. All it does is respond to what the person says. It doesn\u2019t actually think for itself, but executes lines of code that algorithmically makes a response.

Saying that a computer can think for itself is like saying that algorithms and feelings are interchangeable with each other.

The engineer that designed the artificial intelligence programmed it on how to \u201cthink\u201d, therefore it cannot break those boundaries set by the engineer and so it\u2019s not actually the program thinking but it\u2019s only following the algorithm the engineer programmed it to follow. I don\u2019t believe the Turing Test is a valid way to determine whether a machine can think or not because I feel as that it\u2019s impossible for a machine to think in the first place."))))}}]),t}(r.a.Component)),L=a(296),D=[{menuItem:"About",render:function(){return r.a.createElement(L.a.Pane,{attached:!0}," ",r.a.createElement(A,null)," ")}},{menuItem:"Projects",render:function(){return r.a.createElement(L.a.Pane,{attached:!0}," ",r.a.createElement(O,null)," ")}},{menuItem:"Courses",render:function(){return r.a.createElement(L.a.Pane,{attached:!0}," ",r.a.createElement(x,null)," ")}},{menuItem:"Cover",render:function(){return r.a.createElement(L.a.Pane,{attached:!0}," ",r.a.createElement(J,null)," ")}},{menuItem:"Critique",render:function(){return r.a.createElement(L.a.Pane,{attached:!0}," ",r.a.createElement(F,null)," ")}},{menuItem:"Links",render:function(){return r.a.createElement(L.a.Pane,{attached:!0}," ",r.a.createElement(z,null)," ")}}],q=function(e){function t(){var e,a;Object(s.a)(this,t);for(var n=arguments.length,r=new Array(n),i=0;i<n;i++)r[i]=arguments[i];return(a=Object(c.a)(this,(e=Object(m.a)(t)).call.apply(e,[this].concat(r)))).state={color:"grey"},a.handleColorChange=function(e){return a.setState({color:e.target.value})},a}return Object(h.a)(t,e),Object(l.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){var e=this.state.color;return r.a.createElement("div",null,r.a.createElement(L.a,{menu:{color:e,inverted:!0,attached:!0,tabular:!0},panes:D}))}}]),t}(r.a.Component),M=function(e){function t(){return Object(s.a)(this,t),Object(c.a)(this,Object(m.a)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(h.a)(t,e),Object(l.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},r.a.createElement(g,null),r.a.createElement(q,null))}}]),t}(n.Component);Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));o.a.render(r.a.createElement(M,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(e){e.unregister()})},82:function(e,t,a){}},[[148,1,2]]]);
